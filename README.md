# Web Idea Forge

---

## What is it?

Web Idea Forge is a really simple app built using Next.js & Tailwind. I built this to serve as both: a place for me to throw my ideas that I may or may not ever get around to, and as a place that maybe others who are struggling to come up with ideas for what to build next can find inspiration.

## Why?

Project-based learning is without a doubt the best way to learn. It helps reinforce ideas and teaches you more real-world skills than you'll get by just consuming content. This is usually known as "tutorial hell" - where you're perpetually stuck in a cycle of consuming content, thinking it's going to help you get to where you think you need to be, only to go to build something and realize that you still don't know anything.

It's not that you don't know it, it's just that, until you take the time to apply it, that knowledge means nothing. It's just going to slowly fade away. So instead of letting that happen, and allowing your time to go to waste, you have to build things!

... Which is often times easier said than done. It can be hard to think of _what_ to build. You know you need to reinforce that that knowledge you just gained, or build _something_ to show to employers.. but.. you just can't think of _what_ to build. That's where the **Web Idea Forge** can come in handy. It's here to give you _inspiration_ and sometimes ideas on how to get started.

Maybe you won't build any of these projects, but maybe they'll at least get the gears spinning and help you come up with one of your own.

## You can help!

I intend to add ideas as I think of them, the first one being a submission form for this very app. Until I find a way to handle moderation on those submissions so that I'm not letting those of you who are less benign submit things that I wouldn't want my grandma to see, I'm currently accepting idea submissions in the form of a PR.

As of today, 2024-01-24, I don't have a PR template, but I intend to create one to make PRs easier. Until then, feel free to submit a PR if you have an idea you'd like to add to the list! Just know that any ideas submitted here are free for anyone else to use as they see fit.
